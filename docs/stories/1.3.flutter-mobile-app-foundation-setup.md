## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Stories 1.1 and 1.2 have established the ABP Framework backend with PostgreSQL Vietnamese collation support and Angular Poseidon theme integration. The development environment is ready with Docker containers and CI/CD pipeline. ABP backend API is running at https://localhost:44346 and supports JWT authentication.

### Mobile App Scope
This Flutter foundation is designed specifically for 3 core restaurant staff features:
1. **Dine-in ordering** - Staff take orders for customers eating at tables
2. **Table reservations** - Staff manage table bookings and reservations  
3. **Takeaway orders** - Staff process orders for customers taking food away

The mobile app is intentionally simplified to focus on these essential staff workflows, avoiding complexity of full restaurant management features like kitchen displays, inventory, or reporting which will remain on the web platform.

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Mobile Framework**: Flutter 3.x with Dart 3.0+ for cross-platform mobile development  
- **State Management**: Riverpod for reactive state management and dependency injection
- **HTTP Client**: Dio package for API communication with ABP backend
- **Navigation**: go_router for type-safe routing with Vietnamese route names
- **Local Storage**: flutter_secure_storage for JWT token storage
- **Responsive Design**: flutter_screenutil for tablet and smartphone adaptation

```

**Root Package.json Integration**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:mobile": "cd flutter_mobile && flutter run",
    "build:mobile": "cd flutter_mobile && flutter build apk --release",
    "test:mobile": "cd flutter_mobile && flutter test"
  }
}
```

### Authentication Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md and previous story context]

**ABP Backend Integration Points**:
- Backend URL: https://localhost:44346 (standard backend URL)
- OAuth endpoints: `/connect/token` for JWT authentication
- API endpoints: `/api/app/*` following ABP convention
- JWT token refresh: Use refresh_token for session management
- Role-based permissions: Owner, Manager, Cashier, Kitchen Staff, Waitstaff

**Critical Mobile Integration Rules**:
- Always use ABP API endpoints - never create direct database connections
- Use JWT tokens for all authenticated API calls
- Handle token refresh automatically in HTTP interceptor
- Implement offline capability for critical restaurant operations
- Follow ABP permission system for mobile feature access

### Vietnamese Restaurant Mobile Requirements
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md and restaurant context]

**Vietnamese-Only App Specifications**:
- Hard-coded Vietnamese text - no localization system needed
- Currency format: 1.244.444đ (dot thousands separator, đ symbol at end)
- Date format: dd/MM/yyyy (example: 08/08/2025)
- DateTime format: dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss (example: 08/08/2025 14:40:30)
- Vietnamese diacritical marks support in text input and display
- Vietnamese restaurant terminology: "Gọi món", "Đặt bàn", "Mang về"

**Mobile Navigation Structure**:
```dart
// Main navigation items for Vietnamese restaurant (3 core features)
final List<NavigationItem> restaurantNavItems = [
  NavigationItem(
    label: 'Gọi món',  // Vietnamese UI text
    icon: Icons.restaurant,
    route: '/orders'   // English route
  ),
  NavigationItem(
    label: 'Đặt bàn',  // Vietnamese UI text
    icon: Icons.event_seat,
    route: '/reservations'  // English route
  ),
  NavigationItem(
    label: 'Mang về',  // Vietnamese UI text
    icon: Icons.takeout_dining,
    route: '/takeaway'  // English route
  ),
];
```
