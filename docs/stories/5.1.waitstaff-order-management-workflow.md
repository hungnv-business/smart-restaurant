## Dev Notes

### Template-Specific Guidance (Level 2 - Business Logic)

**Implementation Patterns:**
- Use ABP's IApplicationService instead of ICrudAppService for order management to support complex business logic
- Implement Domain Services for order validation, status transitions, and kitchen coordination 
- Use SignalR hubs for real-time status updates between waitstaff and kitchen display
- Apply ABP's domain events pattern for order status changes and notifications

**Required Dependencies:**
- ABP Framework 8.0 with built-in authorization, localization, and in-memory caching support
- SignalR for real-time communication between mobile app and kitchen systems
- Entity Framework Core for database operations with Vietnamese collation support  
- Flutter 3.35.1+ with WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Dart HTTP client for API communication with ABP backend
- ABP Memory Cache for menu and recipe data caching
- **web_socket_channel**: ^2.4.0 package for Flutter WebSocket connectivity
- **provider**: ^6.1.1 for Flutter state management

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash

**File Structure and Naming Conventions:**
```
Backend:
- aspnet-core/src/SmartRestaurant.Domain/Orders/ (entities and domain services)
- aspnet-core/src/SmartRestaurant.Application/Orders/ (application services and DTOs)
- aspnet-core/src/SmartRestaurant.HttpApi/Hubs/ (SignalR hubs)

Flutter Mobile:  
- flutter_mobile/lib/features/orders/ (order management feature)
- flutter_mobile/lib/features/orders/screens/ (order workflow screens)

- flutter_mobile/lib/features/orders/services/ (API client services)
- flutter_mobile/lib/shared/models/ (order data models)
```

### Previous Story Context
From Epic 4 completion - Multi-unit ingredient system established foundation for:
- Menu item availability tracking based on ingredient stock levels
- Cost calculation integration for accurate order pricing
- Kitchen workflow optimization based on ingredient preparation requirements
- **Multi-unit purchase units and base unit conversion system ready for inventory deduction**
- **Basic MenuItem-Ingredient link exists but needs enhancement to MenuItemIngredient many-to-many**

### Migration Strategy
**From MenuItem.PrimaryIngredientId to MenuItemIngredient System**:
1. **Phase 1**: Create MenuItemIngredient table with migration script
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate existing PrimaryIngredientId data to MenuItemIngredient records
3. **Phase 3**: Update application logic to use new many-to-many relationship
4. **Phase 4**: Mark PrimaryIngredientId as Obsolete with backward compatibility
5. **Phase 5**: Remove PrimaryIngredientId in future release (post-story completion)

**Migration Script Template**:
```sql
-- Create MenuItemIngredient records from existing PrimaryIngredientId
INSERT INTO MenuItemIngredients (Id, MenuItemId, IngredientId, RequiredQuantity, IsOptional, CreationTime)
SELECT 
    gen_random_uuid(),
    mi.Id,
    mi.PrimaryIngredientId,
    COALESCE(mi.RequiredQuantity, 1),
    false,
    NOW()
FROM MenuItems mi 
WHERE mi.PrimaryIngredientId IS NOT NULL;
```

### Data Models and Relationships

**Order Entity** (Level 2 complexity):
```csharp
public class Order : FullAuditedAggregateRoot<Guid>
{
    public string OrderNumber { get; set; }         // Display number (e.g., #001)
    public Guid TableId { get; set; }               // Table reference
    public OrderType OrderType { get; set; }        // DineIn/Takeaway
    public OrderStatus Status { get; set; }         // Status workflow
    public decimal TotalAmount { get; set; }        // VND pricing
    public string Notes { get; set; }               // Customer requests
    // Navigation: Table, OrderItems collection
}

public enum OrderStatus 
{
    Pending, Confirmed, Preparing, Ready, Served, Paid
}
```

**MenuItemIngredient Entity** (New for Recipe Management):
```csharp
public class MenuItemIngredient : Entity<Guid>
{
    public Guid MenuItemId { get; set; }           // Reference to MenuItem
    public Guid IngredientId { get; set; }         // Reference to Ingredient  
    public int RequiredQuantity { get; set; }      // Quantity in base unit (e.g., 200g)
    public bool IsOptional { get; set; } = false;  // Optional ingredient flag
    
    // Navigation properties
    public virtual MenuItem MenuItem { get; set; }
    public virtual Ingredient Ingredient { get; set; }
}
```

**Enhanced MenuItem Entity** (Updated for Recipe Support):
```csharp
public class MenuItem : FullAuditedEntity<Guid>
{
    // ... existing properties ...
    
    // Enhanced relationships
    public virtual ICollection<MenuItemIngredient> Ingredients { get; set; } // Many-to-many via bridge
    public virtual ICollection<OrderItem> OrderItems { get; set; }
    
    // Deprecated but maintained for backward compatibility
    [Obsolete("Use Ingredients collection instead")]
    public Guid? PrimaryIngredientId { get; set; }
    [Obsolete("Use Ingredients collection instead")]
    public int? RequiredQuantity { get; set; }
}
```

**SignalR Integration**:  
[Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#Order-Processing-Workflow]
- KitchenHub broadcasts new orders and status changes
- TableManagementHub manages real-time table status updates  
- OrderStatusHub sends notifications to waitstaff about order ready status

### Business Logic Requirements

**Status Transition Rules** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#Order]:
- Pending → Confirmed (waitstaff action)
- Confirmed → Preparing (kitchen action)  
- Preparing → Ready (kitchen action)
- Ready → Served (waitstaff confirmation)
- Served → Paid (payment completion)

**Kitchen Integration** [Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#Kitchen-Workflow]:
- Auto-print kitchen bills on order confirmation
- Manual reprint functionality for specific dishes
- Real-time status broadcasting to kitchen display
- FIFO order prioritization with quick-cook optimization
- **Automatic inventory deduction when order confirmed with negative stock support**
- **Missing ingredients warning system before order confirmation**

### API Specifications

**OrderAppService Endpoints** [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#API-Endpoints]:
```csharp
// ABP auto-generates REST endpoints:
GET /api/app/order                              // List orders with filtering
POST /api/app/order                             // Create new order with recipe validation and missing ingredients warning
PUT /api/app/order/{id}/status                  // Update order status with automatic recipe-based inventory deduction
POST /api/app/order/{id}/print-kitchen-bill     // Manual print functionality
POST /api/app/order/{id}/payment                // Payment integration (Epic 8)
GET /api/app/order/check-missing-ingredients    // Check missing ingredients for order items
GET /api/app/order/{id}/missing-ingredients     // Get missing ingredients for specific order
POST /api/app/recipe/validate-availability      // Validate recipe ingredient availability for menu items
```

**RecipeManager Domain Service Methods**:
```csharp
// Recipe management methods:
Task<List<MissingIngredientDto>> CheckIngredientAvailabilityAsync(Guid menuItemId);
Task<Dictionary<Guid, int>> CalculateRequiredIngredientsAsync(List<OrderItemDto> orderItems);
Task ProcessAutomaticDeductionAsync(Guid orderId); // Supports negative stock
Task<List<MissingIngredientDto>> GetMissingIngredientsAsync(Guid orderId);
```

### Flutter Mobile Architecture Requirements

**Flutter Widget Architecture** [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Flutter-Architecture]:
- Stepper widget for multi-step order process
- GridView for table and menu item display
- ListView for order items and status history  
- SnackBar/Toast widgets for real-time notifications
- SearchDelegate for Vietnamese text search

**Flutter State Management (Provider/BLoC)**:
```dart
class OrderState {
  final Order? currentOrder;
  final Table? selectedTable;  
  final List<MenuItem> availableMenuItems;
  final List<Order> orderHistory;
  final List<MissingIngredient> missingIngredients; // Missing ingredients for warnings
  final bool loading;
  final bool isConnected; // WebSocket connection status
}

class MissingIngredient {
  final String ingredientName;
  final String menuItemName; 
  final int requiredQuantity;
  final int currentStock;
  final String unit;
  final bool isOptional;
  
  String get displayText => "$menuItemName: missing $ingredientName (need ${requiredQuantity}${unit})";
  String get stockDisplayText => "$ingredientName: ${currentStock}${unit}";
}
```

**WebSocket Integration**:
- Use web_socket_channel package for real-time communication
- Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Handle connection state in UI (connected/disconnected indicators)

- Include MenuItemIngredients with Ingredient for recipe calculations
- Use ABP's IQueryable extensions for pagination

**Mobile Performance**:
- WebSocket connection pooling for concurrent mobile users
- Debounced status updates to prevent UI flooding on mobile  
- Local caching for menu data and recipe information with SQLite integration
- Lazy loading for large menu lists and order history
- Image optimization for menu item photos
- Efficient missing ingredients calculation to minimize API calls
- Cache recipe data locally to reduce network requests during order creation

**Server-side Caching (ABP Memory Cache)**:
- Cache menu items and categories to reduce database queries
- Cache recipe configurations to speed up missing ingredients calculations
- Cache user permissions and roles for faster authorization checks
- Configurable cache expiration policies for different data types

### Security Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#Authentication-and-Authorization]
```csharp
[Authorize(SmartRestaurantPermissions.Orders.Create)]  // Order creation
[Authorize(SmartRestaurantPermissions.Kitchen.View)]   // Kitchen access
[Authorize(SmartRestaurantPermissions.Payments.Process)] // Payment handling
```

### Localization Support
