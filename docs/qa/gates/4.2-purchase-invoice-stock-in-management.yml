# Risk Analysis
risks:
  low_risk:
    - "Core CRUD operations - standard ABP patterns"
    - "Entity relationships - properly configured and tested"
    - "Authorization - standard ABP authorization patterns"
    - "UI components - standard PrimeNG components"
    
  medium_risk:
    - "Stock tracking logic complexity requires production testing"
    - "Master-detail transactions need performance monitoring"
    - "Data migration for large datasets may need staging"
